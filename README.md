A Maze Game Written in C

*******************************************************************************
GAME DESCRIPTION:
*******************************************************************************
In this program, I will implement a program for an Easter egg hunt in an 11x19 
maze. My program will (1) read in from an input file the maze information; (2) 
show the egg hunterâ€™s current location; and (3) repetitively moves the egg 
hunter to the direction of his chooses until the egg is found, or the hunter 
gets lost and asks for help, or the hunter quits. My program will display 
the floor plan of the maze and a path to find the egg at the end.
